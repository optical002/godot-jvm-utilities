- Godot project parser. (parses single file)
- Godot CLI (it is empty by design, receives a configuration file, which it reads and runs validations/code-gens from it
the configuration file can contain an online validator which is a maven like link to validator/generator or a local
definition somehow) (should be published to releases and have a manual of how to use)
- Godot Validator Plugin (an api which is required for a plugin to get picked up by cli tool)
- Godot Generator Plugin (an api which is required for a plugin to get picked up by cli tool)
- Sbt Godot CLI (an sbt plugin which uses godot CLI automatically, downloads it and setup it, I want to have
validators/generators setup via .sbt file somehow, should add two tasks to all projects generate/validate)
